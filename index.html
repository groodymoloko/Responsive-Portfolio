         <img id="vanportrait1" src="assets/images/vanportrait1.jpg" alt="Pic of Van"/>
    
        <p>As one can tell from this pic, I suffer from quite a few bad hair days. Luckily, I just don't care that much. What I do care about is my birthplace,
        the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. My research and efforts are now focused on how humans can preserve and regenerate the rich cultural and ecological
        heritage of the most biodiverse desert on Earth. Specifically, how should residential and commercial space be designed and utilized by people in ways that
        enhance wildlife habitat, optimize water and resource use, and reverse a troubling legacy of urban sprawl.
        </p>

        <p>While I consider this the most important pursuit in my life, it does not pay the bills so I am an IT network architect during the day and 
        a student web developer at night, as evidenced by this crappy website.  I also enjoy camping, traveling, and hanging out with my beautiful wife and two lazy dogs. Oh, and running
        long distances to the point where bad things happen.  Racing with the native Rar√°muri runners at the bottom of Copper Canyon in Mexico was a life-changing
        experience.
        <p>

        <p>My current project is a desert botanical garden and drought tolerant food forest in Tucson, which I will be developing over the next decade.  The site
        will feature many of the 540 native Sonoran food plants including Mesquite, Palo Verde, Prickly Pear, agaves, beans, squash, and also edible exotics such as Moringa.
        The primay goal is to demonstrate how people can improve rather than destroy the places we love.
